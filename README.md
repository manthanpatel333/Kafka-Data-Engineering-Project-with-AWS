# Kafka Data Engineering Project

## Project Overview
Welcome to the Kafka Data Engineering Project! This project demonstrates the power of real-time data streaming using Apache Kafka, integrated seamlessly with various AWS services such as S3, Athena, and Glue for efficient storage and analysis. By following this guide, you'll gain hands-on experience in setting up and managing a robust data pipeline, processing real-time stock market data, and performing analytics on the ingested data.

## Architecture Overview
The architecture of this project is designed to ensure smooth data flow from data generation to analysis:

### Producer
- **Stock Market App Simulation**: Generates simulated stock market data in real-time.
- **SDK Boto3**: Utilized for programmatically interacting with AWS services.
- **Dataset**: Source data in CSV format, representing historical stock market information.
- **Kafka Producer**: Responsible for sending the generated data to a Kafka topic, ensuring real-time data streaming capabilities.

### Consumer
- **Amazon EC2**: Runs the Kafka consumer application, providing scalable compute resources.
- **Kafka Consumer**: Reads data from the Kafka topic and processes it accordingly.
- **Amazon S3**: Used for storing processed data, ensuring durability and easy access.
- **AWS Glue Crawler**: Automatically scans the data stored in S3 and updates the Glue Data Catalog.
- **AWS Glue Data Catalog**: Maintains metadata for the datasets, making them easily searchable and queryable.
- **Amazon Athena**: Provides the ability to perform SQL queries on the data stored in S3, facilitating quick and easy data analysis.

## Enhanced Features
To ensure robustness and ease of use, the project includes several enhanced features:
- **Error Handling**: Both the Kafka producer and consumer scripts include comprehensive error handling mechanisms to manage any issues that arise during data processing.
- **Data Validation**: Validation steps are integrated to ensure the data's integrity and quality.
- **Detailed Documentation**: This README provides thorough setup and usage instructions, making it easy to get started and troubleshoot common issues.

## Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### 1. Install Dependencies
First, install the necessary Python packages by running:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Start Kafka and Zookeeper Services
Ensure that Kafka and Zookeeper are up and running. Use the following commands to start the services:
```sh
zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
```

### 3. Run the Enhanced Producer and Consumer Scripts
- Open `KafkaProducer.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and run all cells to start the data producer.
- Open `KafkaConsumer.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and run all cells to start the data consumer.

### 4. Analyze Data
Once the data is being streamed and stored, open the `Analysis.ipynb` notebook. This notebook contains SQL queries and visualization steps to analyze the stored data using Amazon Athena.

## Usage
### Kafka Producer
The Kafka producer generates simulated stock market data and sends it to a specified Kafka topic. This ensures continuous data flow, simulating real-world data streaming scenarios.

### Kafka Consumer
The Kafka consumer reads the streamed data from the Kafka topic, processes it, and stores it in Amazon S3. The consumer also handles data validation and error management, ensuring that only high-quality data is stored for analysis.

### Data Analysis
Using Amazon Athena, you can perform SQL queries on the data stored in S3. The `Analysis.ipynb` notebook provides examples of how to query and visualize this data, turning raw data into actionable insights.

## Troubleshooting
Here are some common issues and their solutions:

- **Kafka Connection Issues**: Ensure that Kafka and Zookeeper services are running and accessible. Check your network settings and configurations.
- **Data Validation Errors**: Review the logs for any validation errors. Adjust the data generation logic in the producer script if necessary to ensure data integrity.
- **AWS Credential Issues**: Make sure your AWS credentials are correctly configured and have the necessary permissions to access S3, Glue, and Athena services.

## Acknowledgements
This project is the result of a collaborative effort to provide a comprehensive learning experience in real-time data streaming and AWS integration. Special thanks to the contributors and the open-source community for their invaluable support and resources.

We hope this project helps you understand the intricacies of data engineering and inspires you to explore more advanced topics in real-time data processing and cloud-based analytics.
